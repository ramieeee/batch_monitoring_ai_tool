# Introduction
Batch Monitoring AI Tool for OpenFrame.
The tool monitors batch status and system resourses and determines whether the batch is looping or not.


# NOTE on 11.05.2022
With the system data the ML model accuracy showed 49 to 50 percent, not more than 51.
It seems that the dataset(CPU, memory usage) is not appropriate and needs other dataset collecting.
It is no use going any further with this project for now.
